# PRM-ReImplementation
This is the re-implementation for "Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation using Class Peak Response". Most of the code are from [ZhouYanzhao/PRM](https://github.com/ZhouYanzhao/PRM/tree/master).

I just extract all the things from Nest framework which is also designed by the same author.
